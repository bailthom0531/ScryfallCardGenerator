# ScryfallCardGenerator

## Description
This project is the beginning of a MTG card roulette game. Set the amount of cards you would like to pull and wait as the app randomly selects the desired amount of cards.

## Features to Add
- Adding the ability to narrow search results to specific attributes. (Color Identity, Card Type, etc.)
- Export list to csv format and possibly directly into online deck builder (Archidekt, Moxfield, etc.)
- Potentially downloading bulk data from Scryfall to prevent excessive API calls.

## Installation
Temporarily unavailable
