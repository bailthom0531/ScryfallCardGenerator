# ScryfallCardGenerator

## Description
This project is the beginning of a MTG card roulette game. Set the amount of cards you would like to pull and wait as the app randomly selects the desired amount of cards.

## Installation Instruction
- On the right side of the v1.0_Beta release homepage, under Releases, click v1.0_Beta.
- In the release window, click the v1.0_Beta.zip file to download the compressed folder.
- Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the folder to your desired location.
- Inside the extracted folder, run ScryfallCardGenerator.exe.
- If Windows Defender appears, click More options and then Run anyway to proceed.

## How to Use the App
- Adjust the value on the main page to change the amount of cards to generate.
- Hit enter or click the "Randomize" button to start the randomization.
- The counter in the bottom left will update as cards generate, so be patient during this process.
- Once all cards are generated a new window will open with the cards sorted in the following sequence
        { Legendary Creatures, Multicolor, White, Blue, Black, Red, Green, Colorless}
- Hovering over a card will enlarge the image for better clarity.

## Features to Add
- Adding the ability to narrow search results to specific attributes. (Color Identity, Card Type, etc.)
- Export list to csv format and possibly directly into online deck builder (Archidekt, Moxfield, etc.)
- Potentially downloading bulk data from Scryfall to prevent excessive API calls.
- Adding legendary cards that can be your commander to the first category. (Backgrounds, Planeswalkers with "can be your Commander", etc.)
